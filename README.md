# Deep Learning (Pytorch)

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Learning v7 Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for RNN in deep learning. the notebooks lead you through implementing a simple RNN model & a character-level LSTM with PyTorch.
